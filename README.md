# frontend-starter-kit
A simple starter kit for front-end projects based on my experience as a front-end web developer. 

I've setup this starter kit based on the tools I currently use and love.


## What's this project about
This starter-kit is a way to document a standard, and reduce time I spend to set up a new project. Here's what you'll get out of the box:

- An opinionated project folder structure (which can be easily reconfigured)
- A gulpfile full of useful functions for different tasks


## Setup
#### Install Node.js
If you don't have Node.js installed, please go ahead and grab it [here](https://nodejs.org/). NPM is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js

To confirm that you have Node.js installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
```
You should get something like `v6.9.1`.

To confirm that you have NPM installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
npm -v
```
You should get something like `3.10.9`.

#### Install Node.js Modules
```bash
npm install
```


## Next steps?
- ES2015 support using Babel.js
- Bundling using Webpack
