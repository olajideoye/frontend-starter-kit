A simple starter kit with reusable functions for front-end projects using [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com).

You can simply grab the gulpfile and config file or use the (rather opinionated) folder structure to start building your project.

## Setup
#### Install Node.js and NPM
If you don't have Node.js installed, please go ahead and grab it [here](https://nodejs.org/). NPM is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js

To confirm that you have Node.js installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
node -v
```
You should get something like `v6.9.1`.

To confirm that you have NPM installed, run the following in your terminal:
```bash
npm -v
```
You should get something like `3.10.9`.

#### Install Node.js Modules
```bash
npm install
```


## Next steps?
- Better documentation on folder structure and Gulp functions available
- Linting
- ES2015 support using Babel.js
